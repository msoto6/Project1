  <h1>My Collection</h1>
  <p>My sister, my niece and I have tried to collect all the Disney princess VHSes and DVDs. Along with that we have a Scooby Doo collection because they're still making movies to this day and it was our childhood dream to collect them all. We also have a bunch of movies we fell in love with so we got them on DVD. Finally we collect series like Pretty Little Liars, Twilight Saga and others.</p>

  <p>In the future, we hope to grow our collection and get more series like Criminal Minds.</p>
  <p>My sister grew up with a bunch of CDs so I continued that collection when she passed them down to me. Then I had an unhealthy obsession with Andrews McMeel Publishing. I tried to get my hands on as many poetry books as I could.</p>
