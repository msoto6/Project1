  <h1>Welcome to my Home Page</h1>
  <h3>This page is mainly dedicated to the people and pets who make up my personality. Also known as my friends and family. Feel free to check out my resume and collection!</h3>
  <h2>Familia</h2>
  <p>My family consists of my parents, my sister and my niece. Here's a picture of me with my parents and my niece.</p>

  <h2>Friends</h2>
  <p><strong>Jessy</strong> is my cousin's daughter. She's around my age, and she's basically my best friend in the family. She's the only person who understands my weirdness.</p>

  <p><strong>Jessica</strong> is a mini me, hence me calling her Mija. We met in theatre and since then we've always been each other's rock.</p>

  <p><strong>Geah</strong> is one of my best friends who took me to Six Flags two days after we formally introduced ourselves. I call her my wifey and Gee-Knee-Bah.</p>

  <h2>Pets</h2>
  <p><strong>Filomeno</strong> is the family pet here in Chicago. He's my father's favorite child and it's kind of sad he gets more instagram likes than me.</p>

  <p>We have my babies who live in Mexico. I miss them so much.</p>
